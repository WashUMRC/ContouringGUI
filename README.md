# ContouringGUI
medical image processing software

**General Workflow**

  - Load data
  - Minimize to relevant data
  - Identify region of interest
  - Run Analysis

**Loading data:** 
> Data can be loaded as DICOM format, TIF, or TXRM (from ZEISS XRM). When loading from TIF, an option to read metadata from a DICOM file is presented; if the user selects cancel, length units default to 1 and no density calibration is used.

**Minimizing to relevant data:**
> Everything in this software runs better the smaller the data set is. To minimize things, use the Zoom to Region button, then draw a square and double click it. Data can be further minimized by drawing a mask over the object you're interested in, pressing Crop to Mask, and then Isolate Object of Interest

**Identify region of interest:**
> To identify a region of interest, create a mask over the object you're interested in. This can be done using the Draw Contour button (and then edited with add and subtract), by using a global threshold method (Set Lower Threshold and then Set Mask to Current Threshold), or by creating primitive circles or rectangles.

**Run analysis:**
> Select the appropriate analysis from the dropdown menu and click Execute Analysis.

**Masking/Contouring**
There are three main options for creating a mask in this software: Directly by drawing, by thresholding, and by creating primitive shapes. 
- Direct drawing 
> Select Draw Contour and then draw a contour by hand. If there is sufficient difference between the background and the object of interest (such as with a cortical bone scan), you can use the Adjust Current Slice button to automatically attempt to adjust to the object's edges. You may also then try to iterate forwards or backwards to automatically add a contour to the next slice and adjust it. Controls are the Method, Smoothing Factor, Contraction Bias, and Iterations. Fewer iterations are required if the geometry doesn't change much.
